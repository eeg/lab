<h3>Emma E. Goldberg</h3>
<p>I joined the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbs.umn.edu/eeb">UMN EEB</a> faculty in January 2014.
I was a grad student with <a class="reference external" href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.lande">Russ Lande</a> at UC San Diego, then a postdoc with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.clfs.umd.edu/biology/faganlab/">Bill Fagan</a> at Univ Maryland, and most recently a postdoc with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.uic.edu/labs/igic/index.html">Boris IgiÄ‡</a> at Univ Illinois Chicago.
Upon moving here, I immediately became addicted to ice skating.

<h3>Tanjona Ramiadantsoa</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="mailto:tramiada&#37;&#52;&#48;umn&#46;edu">Tanjona</a> joined the lab as a postdoc in fall 2014.
He did his PhD work with Ilkka Hanski and Otso Ovaskainen at Univ Helsinki, working on models for ecological, macroevolutionary, biogeographic, and conservation questions.
He is now developing models related to physiology, competition, and range limits.
And he is the EEB soccer captain.</p>

<h3>Heath Blackmon</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://coleoguy.github.io/">Heath</a> joined the lab as a postdoc in summer 2015, for a collaborative project with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tau.ac.il/~itaymay/">Itay Mayrose</a> on chromosome number evolution.
He got his PhD in Jeff Demuth&#8217;s lab at UT Arlington, using comparative methods to study genome evolution, especially of sex chromosomes, especially in beetles.
In spring 2016, Heath earned independent funding as a <a class="reference external" href="http://cbs.umn.edu/blogs/cbs-connect/first-cohort-selected-new-postdoctoral-program">CBS Grand Challenges Postdoc</a>, and we&#8217;re happy that he will still be around!</p>

<h3>Alex Harkness</h3>
<p>Alex joined EEB as a grad student in fall 2015, co-advised with <a class="reference external" href="http://brandvainlab.wordpress.com/">Yaniv Brandvain</a>.
He was previously an undergrad and herbarium intern at the University of Washington.
He is interested in plant mating system evolution and population genetics (and much else, such as strange food products made of fungi).</p>

<div class="section" id="opportunities">
<span id="recruit"></span><h2>Opportunities</h2>
<p>Opportunities are available for students and postdocs to join the lab.
Choices of projects are quite open: inquiries are encouraged from anyone with related <a class="reference internal" href="research.html#research"><span>research interests</span></a> in quantitative aspects of macroevolution, biogeography, coevolution, or plant evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>I expect everyone in the lab group to be resourceful and work to develop their own interests and approaches.
In return, I will be accessible for discussions of everything from broad ideas to technical details.
Lab members are also encouraged to take advantage of expertise in nearby research groups.
See especially our <a class="reference external" href="http://eeg.github.io/theory_lab/">Theory for Life</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://umnevoltwin.com">Evolution in the Twin Cities</a> groups, and the departments of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbs.umn.edu/eeb">Ecology, Evolution &amp; Behavior</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbs.umn.edu/plantbio">Plant Biology</a>.
I will facilitate joint lab meetings and co-advising as appropriate.</p>
<div class="section" id="postdoctoral-researchers">
<h3>Postdoctoral researchers</h3>
<p>Inquiries are welcome from prospective postdocs to pursue projects of their own design.
Some prior modeling and computing experience is helpful, but I am also happy to talk with people who have more empirical backgrounds and would like to explore related questions through theory.
If you are interested, please send me an email introducing yourself and outlining the research areas you would like to pursue with the lab.
We can then discuss specific projects and potential funding sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graduate-students">
<h3>Graduate students</h3>
<p>I am looking for one or two students to join the lab.
Incoming students should have some research experience and quantitative inclinations, but the exact nature of those is flexible&#8212;I am happy to consider students who majored in biology, math, computer science, engineering, or other fields.  (I started in physics myself.)
I expect theses to have a substantial theory component, but I am open to discussing opportunities for complementary empirical work, such as gathering data to test a novel analysis technique or parameterize a model.</p>
<p>I can take students through the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbs.umn.edu/eeb/graduate/future-eeb-graduate-students">EEB grad program</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbs.umn.edu/plantbio/gradprog/about">PlantBio grad program</a>.
Applications are due in early December.
If you would like to apply to either department and perhaps work with me, please send me an email introducing yourself and outlining your interests so that I can look for your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="undergraduate-students">
<h3>Undergraduate students</h3>
<p>I am always happy to hear from students&#8212;majoring in biology, math, computer science, or other fields&#8212;who would like to conduct research in the lab.
On your part, this requires curiosity, diligence, and an interest in thinking about biological questions in quantitative terms.
I can help you identify a tractable question and learn the techniques you need to answer it.</p>
<p>If this interests you, please read about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cbs.umn.edu/students/undergraduate-research/directed-research">directed research in CBS</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.urop.umn.edu/urop.html">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a>.
Then send me an email introducing yourself and briefly describing what you might like to gain from the experience.
We can meet to discuss possible projects and take it from there.</p>
