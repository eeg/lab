<h3>Emma E. Goldberg</h3>
<p>I joined the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbs.umn.edu/eeb">UMN EEB</a> faculty in January 2014.
I was a grad student with <a class="reference external" href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.lande">Russ Lande</a> at UC San Diego, then a postdoc with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.clfs.umd.edu/biology/faganlab/">Bill Fagan</a> at Univ Maryland, and most recently a postdoc with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.uic.edu/labs/igic/index.html">Boris IgiÄ‡</a> at Univ Illinois Chicago.
Upon moving here, I immediately became addicted to ice skating.

He did his PhD work with Ilkka Hanski and Otso Ovaskainen at Univ Helsinki, working on models of ecological, macroevolutionary, biogeographic, and conservation questions.
His work here will continue to be conducted with boundless enthusiasm!</p>

<span id="recruit"></span><h2>Opportunities</h2>
<p>Opportunities are available for students and postdocs to join the lab.
Choices of projects are quite open: inquiries are encouraged from anyone with related <a class="reference internal" href="research.html#research"><em>research interests</em></a> in quantitative aspects of macroevolution, biogeography, coevolution, or plant evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>I expect everyone in the lab group to be resourceful and work to develop their own interests and approaches.
In return, I will be accessible for discussions of everything from broad ideas to technical details.
Lab members are also encouraged to take advantage of expertise in nearby research groups.
See especially our <a class="reference external" href="http://eeg.github.io/theory_lab/">Theory for Life</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://umnevoltwin.com">Evolution in the Twin Cities</a> groups, and the departments of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbs.umn.edu/eeb">Ecology, Evolution &amp; Behavior</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbs.umn.edu/plantbio">Plant Biology</a>.
I will facilitate joint lab meetings and co-advising as appropriate.</p>
<div class="section" id="postdoctoral-researchers">
<h3>Postdoctoral researchers</h3>
<p>One postdoc position is currently available for a collaborative project with the lab of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tau.ac.il/~itaymay/">Itay Mayrose</a>.
The general topic is phylogenetic comparative study of the effects of ploidy and breeding system on rates of micro- and macroevolution.
We have extensive datasets in hand and some specific project ideas regarding rates of sequence evolution and lineage diversification, but there is substantial flexibility in developing projects within the general theme.
Please direct informal inquiries to Emma, but note that formal applications must go through the university&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://employment.umn.edu/applicants/Central?quickFind=125309">HR site</a>.</p>
<p>Inquiries are also welcome from prospective postdocs to pursue other projects.
Some prior modeling and computing experience is helpful, but I am also happy to talk with people who have more empirical backgrounds and would like to explore related questions through theory.
If you are interested, please send me an email introducing yourself and outlining the research areas you would like to pursue with the lab.
We can then discuss specific projects and potential funding sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graduate-students">
<h3>Graduate students</h3>
<p>I am looking for one or two students to join the lab.
Incoming students should have some research experience and quantitative inclinations, but the exact nature of those is flexible&#8212;I am happy to consider students who majored in biology, math, computer science, engineering, or other fields.  (I started in physics myself.)
I expect theses to have a substantial theory component, but I am open to discussing opportunities for complementary empirical work, such as gathering data to test a novel analysis technique or parameterize a model.</p>
<p>I can take students through the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbs.umn.edu/eeb/graduate/future-eeb-graduate-students">EEB grad program</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbs.umn.edu/plantbio/gradprog/about">PlantBio grad program</a>.
Applications are due in early December.
If you would like to apply to either department and perhaps work with me, please send me an email introducing yourself and outlining your interests so that I can look for your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="undergraduate-students">
<h3>Undergraduate students</h3>
<p>I am always happy to hear from students&#8212;majoring in biology, math, computer science, or other fields&#8212;who would like to conduct work in the lab.
On your part, this requires curiosity, diligence, and an interest in thinking about biological questions in quantitative terms.
I can help you identify a tractable question and learn the techniques you need to answer it.</p>
<p>If this interests you, please read about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cbs.umn.edu/students/undergraduate-research/directed-research">directed research in CBS</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.urop.umn.edu/urop.html">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a>.
Then send me an email introducing yourself and briefly describing what you might like to gain from the experience.
We can meet to discuss possible projects and take it from there.</p>
