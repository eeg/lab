Emma E. Goldberg
----------------

I joined the `UMN EEB`_ faculty in January 2014.
I was a grad student with `Russ Lande`_ at UC San Diego, then a postdoc with `Bill Fagan`_ at Univ Maryland, and most recently a postdoc with `Boris IgiÄ‡`_ at Univ Illinois Chicago.
Upon moving here, I immediately became addicted to ice skating.

Tanjona Ramiadantsoa
------------------------

We will be welcoming Tanjona to the lab as a postdoc later this year!
He is currently finishing his PhD with Ilkka Hanski and Otso Ovaskainen at Univ Helsinki, working on models of ecological, macroevolutionary, biogeographic, and conservation questions.

Recruitment
===========

Opportunities are available for students and postdocs to join the lab.
Choices of projects are quite open: inquiries are encouraged from anyone with related :ref:`research interests <research>` in quantitative aspects of macroevolution, biogeography, coevolution, or plant evolutionary biology.

I expect everyone in the lab group to be resourceful and work to develop their own interests and approaches.
In return, I will be accessible for discussions of everything from broad ideas to technical details.
Lab members are also encouraged to take advantage of expertise in nearby research groups.
See especially our `Theory for Life`_ and `Evolution in the Twin Cities`_ groups, and the departments of `Ecology, Evolution & Behavior`_ and `Plant Biology`_.
I will facilitate joint lab meetings and co-advising as appropriate.

Postdoctoral researchers
------------------------

Inquiries are welcome from prospective postdocs with prior modeling and computing experience, and also from those with more empirical backgrounds who would like to explore related questions through theory.
If you are interested, please send me an email introducing yourself and outlining the research areas you would like to pursue with the lab.
We can then discuss specific projects and potential funding sources.

Graduate students
-----------------

I am looking for one or two students to join the lab.
Incoming students should have some research experience and quantitative inclinations, but the exact nature of those is flexible---I am happy to consider students who majored in biology, math, computer science, engineering, or other fields.  (I started in physics myself.)
I expect theses to have a substantial theory component, but I am open to discussing opportunities for complementary empirical work, such as gathering data to test a novel analysis technique or parameterize a model.

I can take students through the `EEB grad program`_ and the `PlantBio grad program`_.
Applications are due in early December.
If you would like to apply to either department and perhaps work with me, please send me an email introducing yourself and outlining your interests so that I can look for your application.

Undergraduate students
----------------------

I am always happy to hear from students---majoring in biology, math, computer science, or other fields---who would like to conduct work in the lab.
On your part, this requires curiosity, diligence, and an interest in thinking about biological questions in quantitative terms.
I can help you identify a tractable question and learn the techniques you need to answer it.

.. Your career goals need not include academic biology for this experience to be valuable: practice with logical thinking and analysis, along with basic math and computer skills, will be useful in any field.

If this interests you, please read about `directed research in CBS`_ and the `Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program`_.
Then send me an email introducing yourself and briefly describing what you might like to gain from the experience.
We can meet to discuss possible projects and take it from there.
