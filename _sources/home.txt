Welcome
=======

The lab of Emma Goldberg recently opened its doors in the department of `Ecology, Evolution & Behavior`_ at the `University of Minnesota`_.
Our :ref:`research interests <research>` center around biogeography and plant mating systems, mostly through the lens of evolutionary theory and phylogenetic comparative methods.

Please see the :ref:`recruitment information <recruit>` if you are interested in joining the lab.

And we are not alone!

* `Theory for Life`_: We host weekly joint lab meetings about in-progress work on mathematical modeling in biology.  All are welcome to attend, participate, and receive feedback on ongoing work. 

* `Evolution in the Twin Cities`_: We join with other with evolutionary enthusiasts for "evoltwin" weekly meetings and other events.

We're in the `Ecology Building`_ on the St Paul campus.
